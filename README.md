HabitLogger is a console application that uses SQLite and ADO.NET to allow the user to log instances of his habits.
A db is created using the connection string in the appSettingsExtra.json. It can be adapted to store to a different db.
The habit menu allows the user to create/delete habits and set one as active. 
DrinkingWater is a habit available by default to the user.
The log menu allows the user to log the dates when they practiced the active habit.
